"""AG2 Network Module — agent-to-agent communication infrastructure.

Network-specific imports (Hub, delegation, topology, channels, remote).
Framework-core features (Actor, policies, observers, knowledge, etc.)
are now in ``autogen.beta`` directly.

Usage::

    from autogen.beta import Actor, ConversationPolicy, TokenMonitor
    from autogen.beta.network import Hub, Network, Pipeline, RateLimiter
